# hacktoberfest
This repo is participating in Hactober fest 2021. It contains the
basic programs like searching, sorting, pattern making, swapping 
in HTML, Python, C and C++ language. You can contribute to this 
repo by adding a small program to it. This will give you the
confidence that you contribute in an open project and will give 
you a reward too.
